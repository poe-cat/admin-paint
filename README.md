# admin-paint
It's a simple administrator's system with CRUD, built with Java, Spring Boot (with Spring Security) and PostgreSQL.
Of course, you can find HTML (a lot), CSS, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf here.
The system has 2 roles: ADMIN and USER. You can login using [justUser, Passing123] or [justAdmin, Passing123] as username and password.  
If the user is not admin, some routes are restricted.

I am going to extend this project with additional functions (register system, email sender, more relations in database, etc.).
